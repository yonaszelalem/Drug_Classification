During medical researcher of treatment, each patient responded to one of two
medications. We call them drug A and drug B. Aim of this project is to build a model
to find out which drug might be appropriate for a future patient with the same illness.
The feature sets of this dataset are age, gender, blood pressure, and cholesterol of
our group of patients and the target is the drug that each patient responded to.
 here decision tree model is used.
